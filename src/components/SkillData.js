        becomepara: "Masons use bricks, stones, and cement to build structures like houses, walls, and pathways. Humans have practiced masonry for thousands of years, and the techniques and materials used in the trade have evolved over time. Masons may work with brick, concrete blocks, cement, fire- and heat-resistant materials, and stones like marble and granite. Masons can specialize as bricklayers, marble or tile setters, cement masons, block masons, or stone masons. Some masons specialize in finishing while others specialize in cleaning, caulking, and pointing.",
        heading: "What kind of training is required to become a mason?",
        info: "Most new masons receive their training through an apprenticeship. Apprenticeship programs are offered by technical and community colleges, professional mason’s and builder’s associations, and masonry unions. In most cases, to enter an apprenticeship you must be at least 18 years old and have a high school diploma or GED. Prospective apprentices may also be required to pass an aptitude test.Apprenticeship programs in masonry last three to four years and include classroom instruction and on-the-job training. Apprentices are sponsored by an employer or union and paid on a scale during training; as they progress in their program, apprentices earn a higher wage and additional job benefits like health insurance and vacation time. They also attend classes, typically at night, to learn knowledge related to their trade.The classroom learning in a masonry apprenticeship includes instruction in reading blueprints, construction math, and the history of the trade. Apprentices also learn about the tools and materials used in their trade. The specifics covered in on-the-job training depend on the type of masonry the apprentice is studying. Cement mason apprentices spend a significant amount of time learning how to set forms, establish grades, spread and finish cement, and create steps and trim, for example. Bricklayer apprentices learn how to clean and repair existing masonry, perform waterproofing, and construct walls, arches, columns, and decorative brick patterns."
